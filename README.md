I photographed Barrel Races, Rodeos, ect.  So in order to maximize the buying at the event you need to Show/Sell/Print the pictures onsite.  This piece was used by my booth help - that a lot of times I found on craigslist and didnt know.  The goal was to make it as easy as possible for them to automate the pictures going into photoshop to do a quick edit and print, tell them how much money to collect and who to get the money from.  If for some reason we did not print onsite I added a function where I could print 3 across labels and mail the orders myself.  I had also added a function to where if I was shooting a super large file that it would take the contents of the folder and save the jpg to a smaller file size in a different folder.  Unfortunately, this was kinda a bust because it took too long and my computer wouldn't allow you to do too much while processing.  Lastly, there is also a function to setup where the file are going and set pricing.  This would edit a XML file and then you would copy it the XML file to other computers.   All told this program made it so I was able to make about 12K NET a year working about 21 days a year.
